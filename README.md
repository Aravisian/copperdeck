CopperdeckIII-GTK-Theme

Inspired by and based on Treetogs (and Pixstudio) amazing Copperdeck-II Desktop theme on Windowblinds.

As you can see, there are certain differences... I toned some elements down. Had to get with the times, I guess. There are other things that are quite different between Linux and M.S. Windows that made certain changes necessary. This is a modern Incarnation, more than a port. For that reason, rather than re-uploading the gtk2/gtk3 Copperdeck II - I opted to do a ReMake and dub it Copperdeck3.
(UPDATE 18 Jan 2022: added clarity for XFCE4-Panel Sn buttons)

For XFCE 4.14 or 4.16, Cinnamon or Mate, gtk2 and gtk3.20 and up (Not gtk4).

Includes theme for Stark Menu, Cinnamenu, Whiskermenu, Brisk Menu, advanced Mate Menu and Zorinmenu Lite.
